Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
Overview
Welcome to the Disease Prediction project! This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of various diseases based on patient data. The primary goal is to provide early warnings and enable preventive measures, improving patient outcomes and optimizing healthcare resources.

Features
Disease Prediction: Predicts the likelihood of diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and more based on patient data.
User-Friendly Interface: An integrated UI design that allows users to easily input data and view predictions.
Data Visualization: Visual representations of patient data and prediction results.
Model Accuracy: Utilizes various machine learning algorithms to ensure high accuracy in predictions.
Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Python, Flask/Django
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras
Database: SQL/NoSQL (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB)
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn!
